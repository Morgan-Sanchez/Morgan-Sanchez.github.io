                    <p>
                        As an undergrad, I studied both music and biomedical engineering as part of a double degree program. 
                        This is also where I had my first research experience in the Johns Hopkins University Applied 
                        Physics Lab (JHUAPL) CIRCUIT program. At JHU and APL, I had the opportunity to work in a variety of spaces
                        ranging from nanoscale connectomics and precision medicine to neuromorphic computing and robotics, 
                        where I fell in love with research, machine learning, and neuroscience, and, most importantly, itâ€™s
                        where I developed a passion for mentorship and outreach. I began as a student and quickly 
                        transitioned to a leadership role, mentoring students and overseeing the first iteration 
                        of the high school version of CIRCUIT. <br />
                        <br />
                        In August of 2021, I moved to Boston to pursue my PhD, supported by the Biomedical
                        Informatics and Data Science Research Training (BIRT) fellowship. Here, I pursued rotations 
                        in labs in both the nanoscale connectomics and healthcare AI spaces (

                        chose to join the Manrai lab and focus on kidney function estimation, but I am grateful 
                        for the opportunities I've had to learn and grow in my undergraduate and rotation research 
                        experiences.

                                    resolution, researchers have collected increasingly large, even petascale,
                                    connectomics datasets. These datasets
                                    have the potential to form the basis for the next generation of brain atlases at

                                    Patients</h4>
                                <p style="font-size: 0.7em; line-height: 1.5em;">Previous work has demonstrated that the
                                    severity of lung damage in experimental models of ventilator-induced lung injury
                                    depend on the mechanical power of the ventilator. In this project, we build machine
                                    learning models (using the Phillips
                                    eICU Database) that leverage patient data (including demographics, ventilator
                                    settings, lab values, etc.) to predict
                                    whether a ventilated patient will deteriorate or expire. Such a model could be used
                                    to inform decisions about patient-specific
                                    ventilator settings or alert clinicians to deteriorating patients.

                                    Alzheimer's is a disease that causes patients to progressively lose memory and
                                    cognitive function, typically living
                                    only 4-7 years after diagnosis due to limited treatment options. Biochemically,
                                    Alzheimer's is known to be associated
                                    with extracellular deposits of Amyloid-Beta peptide, or plaques, but causality and
                                    mechanism are not fully understood.
                                    Therefore, as part of a rotation in Jeff Lichtman's lab at Harvard, I studied the
                                    relationship between proximity to plaque
                                    material and synapse density in an effort to better understand whether plaque may be
                                    contributing to cognitive deficits
                                    through toxicity to synaptic activity. To do this, we ran synapse, membrane, and
                                    plaque detection models on an electron
                                    microscopy volume to obtain noisy annotations, filtered those annotations
                                    automatically, and estimated synapse distributions
                                    close to and far from a plaque of interest.

                                    In recent years, the application of machine learning to healthcare has become an
                                    increasingly
                                    popular research area. Perhaps more exciting, however, is the recent upsurge
                                    in prospective studies, even randomized controlled trials, for AI-supported health
                                    tools, the lack of which
                                    has previously held research back from translation. In this project we aim to
                                    systematically determine the
                                    current state of the field through review of recent randomized controlled trials.
